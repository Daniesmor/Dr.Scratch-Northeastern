drScratch
=========

drScratch is an analytical tool that evaluates your Scratch projects in a variety of computational areas to provide feedback on aspects such as abstraction, logical thinking, synchronization, parallelization, flow control, user interactivity and data representation. This analyzer is a helpful tool to evaluate your own projects, or those of your Scratch students.

## For use Batch Mode and Contact Form
For use Batch Mode and Contact Form you will need to set up an email, you can use the provider you preffer. Remember that it's important the email can be used in a website environment. For set up the email in Dr. Scratch in order to use the Batch Mode and the Contact Form, you have to open the **.env** file and fill the put the email and the password in his corresponding line. **DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL** and **EMAIL_HOST_USER** for the email and **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD** for the password.
